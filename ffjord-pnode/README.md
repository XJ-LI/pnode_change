## How to get the datasets

To run `train_tabular.py`, MAF tabular datasets are required. They can be downloaded from: [https://zenodo.org/record/1161203#.Wmtf_XVl8eN](https://zenodo.org/record/1161203#.Wmtf_XVl8eN)

The file needed is  `data.tar.gz`. Unpack it and place it (the `data` folder) in the same folder as `train_tabular.py`.

As clarified in the URL link above, these datasets are preprocessed versions of public datasets. The original datasets are:
